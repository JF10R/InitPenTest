# InitPenTest

Initializes a pentest folder structure and creates two scripts: initial_scan.sh and detailed_scan.sh.
The first script runs a full nmap scan on the specified IP address and stores the results in scans/initial.nmap.
The second script runs a detailed nmap scan on the open ports found in scans/initial.nmap, limits the scope of the scan to the IP's subnet, and stores the results in scans/detailed.nmap.

## Usage:
`initpentest [folder] [ip_address]`

## Installation
I did not add the `#!/bin/bash` command on top of the file for the simple reason that I am sourcing this file from my `.zshrc`, mostly our of preference:
I also removed the `.sh` extension, again, out of preference for partial scripts.
```bash
# Loading initpentest  
source ~/.initpentest
```

## Structure

Here is an overview of the structure it creates

```
.[folder]
├── exploit
├── loot
├── Notes.md
├── scans
│   ├── detailed.nmap
│   └── initial.nmap
└── scripts
    ├── detailed_scan.sh
    └── initial_scan.sh
```

The `Notes.md` folder has a basic header pre-filled with the name of the folder (usually the name of the machine targetted) along with the IP Address with this format:

> **Important:** This format within `Notes.md` is used by the scripts to target the right IP Address.

```markdown
# Machine Name
## <Ip Address>
```

I'm a sloppy bash coder so forgiven the wacky syntax and feel free to provide constructive criticism if you feel like it!
